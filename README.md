Welcome to the Real-Time Chat Application! This project is a dynamic and interactive chat platform built with Python, Flask, and Socket.IO, allowing users to communicate seamlessly in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-Time Messaging:** Instant message delivery and updates using WebSockets.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login system.
*   **User Profiles:** Customizable user profiles with names and profile pictures.
*   **Profile Photo Uploads:** Users can upload their profile pictures, hosted via ImgBB.
*   **Online Status:** See which users are currently online or offline.
*   **Last Seen:** Track when users were last active.
*   **Direct Messaging:** Engage in private conversations with other users.
*   **Message Read Status:** Know when your messages have been read by the recipient.

    *   Gevent (as a concurrent networking library for SocketIO)
*   **Frontend:**
    *   HTML5
    *   CSS3
    *   JavaScript (Vanilla JS for client-side interactions)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chamika1/chat_app.git
    cd chat_app
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The `requirements.txt` file includes:
    ```
    Flask==2.3.3
    Flask-SocketIO==5.3.6
    python-engineio==4.7.1
    python-socketio==5.9.0
    Werkzeug==2.3.7
    gevent==23.9.1
    gevent-websocket==0.10.1
    requests
    ```

4.  **ImgBB API Key:**
    This application uses ImgBB to host profile pictures. You'll need to get your own API key from [ImgBB](https://api.imgbb.com/).
    Once you have your key, open `app.py` and replace `'YOUR_IMGBB_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual key:
    ```python
    # ImgBB API Key
    IMGBB_API_KEY = 'API_KEY' # Replace with your key 
    ```
    *(The provided key in the source might be a placeholder or a test key. It's best practice to use your own.)*

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

1.  Ensure you have completed the setup steps above.
2.  Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:5010
    ```
    (The port was recently updated to 5010. If you encounter issues, double-check the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block in `app.py` for the correct port.)
